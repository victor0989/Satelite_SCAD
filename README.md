This repository contains One Collection of scripts and files in openSCAD and freecad for satellite projects. 1) Propulsion systems 2) VHDL sensors ideas focused on the idea of Hardware simulation for critical space systems and radiation environments, pressure, temperature, oscilloscopes. The idea is to simulate the structures in openSCAD or VHDL for the radiation, ion thrusters meassurements not just to develop the tipical Boring spanish enterprise hardware with not focul on what is important simulate or design in real system rather to waste time in big challenges and big projects that waste the time of people who is practical and pragmatic.
