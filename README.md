This repository contains One Collection of scripts and files in openSCAD and freecad for satellite projects. 1) Propulsion systems 2) VHDL sensors ideas focused on the idea of Hardware simulation for critical space systems and radiation environments, pressure, temperature, oscilloscopes. The idea is to simulate the structures in openSCAD or VHDL for the radiation, ion thrusters meassurements not just to develop the tipical Boring spanish enterprise hardware with not focul on what is important simulate or design in real system rather to waste time in big challenges and big projects that waste the time of people who is practical and pragmatic. 

1. Open your freeCAD GUI once you download the .exe.

Menu freecad
2. Open in the Menu -> Macro small section -> choose Macro-> create Macro, give it the name of your freeCAD macro. Once you did that, write the code example from this repository or download them, use them in create Macro, the new Macro file is empty, just paste the code, save it in (file) save (file) and execute Macro from the pallete Menu the main menu options (macro...)

3.OpenSCAD is straight forward, once you have downloaded the application just paste the code ideas and try to study or follow your own criteria.
